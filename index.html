<h1 style="color:pink;">Tillie & Coding</h1>
<h3 style="color:hotpink;">I have no idea what i'm doing, but here is my experience so far with GWC.</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Things we've gone over so far:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
  <li>Scratch</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Robotics</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We started  off with Scratch which made me feel like coding was a piece of cake.....I was wrong.
  That second week when we started with Python I knew that this wasn't going to come easy. My struggle with
  Python and this program as a whole was and is because of my fear of asking questions and looking stupid.
  Which in hindset I guess would make taking a class to learn something kind of redundant.
  Robotics has been one of my favorite units so far.
  That unit showed me that I like working with hardware more than software. It also made me realize how important it is to work with a team.
  Without them my or should I say our robot wouldn't have been able to do anything, but look pretty honestly.</p>

<p>What we're learning now:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Web Dev</li>
  </ul>
<p>We just started Web Dev literally a day ago, but I already know it's going to my favorite lesson.
  It's seems to be the quickest and easist thing we've done so far and it's fun. I like it cause it doesn't feel like there's as much pressure.
  You can literally make a pretty basic website within 30mins.</p>
<h3 style="color:hotpink;">What I've learned</h3>
<p>In this program I've learned to accept that I can't be the best at eveything.
  Okay, let me correct myself i'm trying to accept that i'm not going to be the best at
  everything. It reminded of my transition from from 8th grade to High School. I was an overachiever
  who had never seen anything lower than an A- before the beg/mid of 10th grade. I got a B+ and it completely
  crushed me. I kid you not I actually cried. I thought I was stupid and didn't even want to try anymore.
  That was wrong I was in a fixed mindset then. I thought I was already in a growth mindest, but hadn't really gotten there
  until I had to struggle to be "good" at something. Now I truly understand that anyone can be good at anything
  as long as they're are willing to work and practice hard enough.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This program has also helped with time management and responsibility.
  This is the first time I have had to actually use public tranportation to get from place to place. Which has been a very frustrating experience i'm glad
  I was forced to go through. Despite my struggles I've  still learned a lot in short my time here.
  Should I work in CS I would definitely be a front-end developer.
  Though, I don't think i'll be looking for a career in CS. Career goal or not CS skills are useful in my everyday life and
  I'm glad that I have them.</p>
